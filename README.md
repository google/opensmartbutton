# Open Smart Button

Open Smart button is a project to create affordable Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) buttons
that can be used to power actions on Smartphones.

Open Smart button is composed of:

 * Information/blueprints to 3D-print your own buttons and equipped them with the 
   necessary hardware.

 * The uC SW reads pushes of the button and transmitt them to the smartphone via BLE.

 * An android app that receives info from the button via BLE and sends Android intents
   that triggers actions on other app(s) on the phone.
